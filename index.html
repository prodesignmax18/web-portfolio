            <p>What makes a good developer?
                Good developers often have excellent technical skills and write clean, neat code. Their code is frequently well commented and can be easily understood by other team members, allowing it to be easily debugged. Good developers also show an awareness of their limitations and the technologies they haven't yet mastered</p>
